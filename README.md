# part one
## find a perfect test

- [ ] https://github.com/rajyash1904/ATM-Machine
- [X] https://github.com/mdhasanai/BMI-CALCULATOR

search for java project which have complex function and perfect for automatic test generation.

# part two
## choose the type of test generation

- [ ] SPI
- [ ] ART
- [X] SBT
- [ ] MBT
- [ ] Symbolic

Using Search-based test generation, we will generate suitable number of tests for the chosen application.

# part three
## choose the tool of automatic test generation

- [ ] Randoop
- [ ] JUnit QuickCheck
- [ ] Pex
- [X] Evosuite
- [ ] CodePro AnalytiX
- [ ] AgitarOne

Evosuite primarily focuses on generating automated tests using search-based testing. It utilizes evolutionary algorithms and intelligent search techniques to create targeted and comprehensive tests that aim to achieve high code coverage.

By employing evolutionary algorithms, evosuite generates new tests iteratively and performs testing on them. In each iteration, tests that achieve higher code coverage are selected, and new tests are generated by introducing random mutations and variations in the input space.

Additionally, evosuite also incorporates other techniques simultaneously. These techniques include input space partitioning, adaptive random testing, model-based testing, and symbolic execution. By combining these methods, evosuite aims to create extensive and reliable automated tests for Java programs.
